This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that is written in Python 3.8.

Let's go through each line of the code and explain it in comments:

```python
import itertools
```
This line imports the `itertools` module, which is used to create iterators for efficient looping.

```python
def win(current_game):
```
This line defines a function named `win` that takes one argument called `current_game`. This function checks if a player has won the tic-tac-toe game.

```python
    def all_same(l):
        if l.count(l[0]) == len(l) and l[0] != 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
This defines a helper function `all_same(l)` that checks if all elements in the list `l` are the same and not equal to 0. It's used to check if there's a winner in a row, column, or diagonal.

```python
    # Horizontal
    for row in game:
        print(row)
        if all_same(row):
            print(f"Player {row[0]} is the winner horizontally!")
            return True
```
This part of the code checks for a horizontal win. It loops through each row in the `current_game` and checks if all elements in the row are the same. If they are, it means a player has won horizontally, and the function returns `True`.

```python
    # Diagonal
    diags = []
    for col, row in enumerate(reversed(range(len(game)))):
        diags.append(game[row][col])
    if all_same(diags):
        print(f"Player {diags[0]} is the winner diagonally (/)!")
        return True
```
This part of the code checks for a diagonal win from top-left to bottom-right (like `/`). It creates a list `diags` containing elements from the diagonal and checks if all elements in `diags` are the same.

```python
    diags = []
    for ix in range(len(game)):
        diags.append(game[ix][ix])
    if all_same(diags):
        print(f"Player {diags[0]} is the winner diagonally (\\)!")
        return True
```
This part of the code checks for a diagonal win from top-right to bottom-left (like `\`). It creates a list `diags` containing elements from the diagonal and checks if all elements in `diags` are the same.

```python
    # Vertical
    for col in range(len(game)):
        check = []

        for row in game:
            check.append(row[col])
        if all_same(check):
            print(f"Player {check[0]} is the winner vertically (|)!")
            return True
```
This part of the code checks for a vertical win. It loops through each column in the `current_game` and creates a list `check` containing elements from that column. It then checks if all elements in `check` are the same.

```python
    return False
```
If there is no win in any direction, the function returns `False`.

```python
def game_board(game_map, player=0, row=0, column=0, just_display=False):
```
This line defines a function named `game_board` that takes several arguments: `game_map` (the tic-tac-toe board), `player` (the current player's number), `row` (the row where the player wants to play), `column` (the column where the player wants to play), and `just_display` (a boolean to determine if the board should be displayed without making any moves).

The function is responsible for displaying the game board, handling player moves, and checking for valid moves.

```python
    try:
```
The code inside this `try` block attempts to execute, and if any error occurs, it will be caught by the corresponding `except` block.

```python
        if game_map[row][column] != 0:
            print("This position is occupado! Choose another!")
            return game_map, False
```
This part of the code checks if the chosen position (`row` and `column`) on the game board is already occupied by a player. If it is, it prints a message and returns `False` to indicate an invalid move.

```python
        print("   "+"  ".join([str(i) for i in range(len(game_map))]))
```
This line prints the column numbers at the top of the game board for players to reference while making moves.

```python
        if not just_display:
            game_map[row][column] = player
```
If `just_display` is `False`, meaning it's a real move and not just for displaying the board, this line updates the game board by placing the current player's number in the chosen position (`row` and `column`).

```python
        for count, row in enumerate(game_map):
            print(count, row)
```
This loop iterates through each row in the `game_map` and prints the current state of the game board.

```python
        return game_map, True
```
The function returns the updated `game_map` and `True` to indicate a successful move.

```python
    except IndexError as e:
        print("Error: make sure you input row/column as 0 1 or 2?", e)
        return game_map, False
```
If the player tries to make a move in a position that is out of the board's range (row or column not in 0, 1, or 2), this `except` block catches the `IndexError` and prints an error message. It returns `game_map` and `False` to indicate an invalid move.

```python
    except Exception as e:
        print("Something went very wrong!", e)
        return game_map, False
```
If any other unexpected error occurs during the execution of the function, this `except` block catches it and prints an error message. It returns `game_map` and `False` to indicate an invalid move.

The rest of the code is a tic-tac-toe game loop that takes input from players, checks for wins using the `win()` function, and handles game restarts and exits.

That's a detailed explanation of each line of the code! It's a tic-tac-toe game with a win-checking function. üéÆüêç
